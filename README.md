# Summary 
This project goal is to analyze the data and gain insights into the factors contributing to car accidents, especially identifying areas where collision frequency is high and what safety measures is needed to prevent furture accident. The ultimate objective is to establish a more comprehensive understanding of car accidents in New York, promote safer driving practices by inducing traffic sign at majore areas, oreinted them on road safety rules and introduce no over speed sign at some designated areas which i believe will reduce the number of accidents in the city. 

Vehicle accidents are a significant public safety concern, resulting in thousands of injuries and fatalities every year. In New York, the problem is particularly severe, with hundreds of thousands of accidents reported annually. This dataset offers a comprehensive view of car accidents in New York, including date, time and location of the accident (borough, zip code, street name, latitude/longitude), vehicles and victims involved, and contributing factors.

## Tools used
1. Excel for data cleaning
    - power query in Excel.
2. Excel for analysis,
    - Pivot Tables.
3. Excel for Dashboard.
4. Power point for slide viewing.

### DATA CLEANING
The dataset was downloaded through a captstone, which i uploaded on power query using excel. The data was cleaned by replacing the empty blank cells with values, New columns i.e year, hour, day of week, quarter, total killed and total injured were added on my spread sheet to give more detail and understanding dataset in order to give an accurate insight.

### Analysis using Pivot Table
After cleaning the Dataset, i move over to my pivot table to analysis my questions.

## Questions for Analysis 
1. Compare the % of total accidents by month. Do you notice any seasonal patterns?
From the chart below, you will notice that March and January has the hightest accident rate

2. Break down accident frequency by day of week and hour of day. Based on this data, when do accidents occur most frequently?

3. On which particular street were the most accidents reported? What does that represent as a % of all reported accidents?
4. What was the most common contributing factor for the accidents reported in this sample (based on Vehicle)? What about fatal accidents specifically?

## INSIGHT AND RECCOMENDATION
 1. March, January had specifically hiher accidents and decreased from July-December during 2021-2023.
 2. Accidents peak during rush hours morning period, we have (8-11 AM) and evening during close of work, we have (4-6PM). expecially on friday.
 3. Belt pathway, Broadway and Atlantic Avenue might have the highest number of accidents, contributing to 15.18%, 11.38% and 9.08 respectively of total accidents ranging from 2021-2023. 
    this may indicates a need for traffic calming measures or pedestrian infrastructure, or better still the both.
 4. The major contributing factor for the total accidents is cause by driver intention/ distraction, followed by unspecified cause which is 58308, 58262. This may indicate negliegence or 
    non-challant atitude
    While the major fatal accident (death) is cause by unspecified , unsafe speed and driver intention/ distraction. 
    This indicate failure to yield the right -way i.e golden road rules and speeding.
