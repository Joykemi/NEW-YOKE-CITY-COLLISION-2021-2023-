# Summary 
Car accidents are a significant public safety concern, resulting in thousands of injuries and fatalities every year. In New York, the problem is particularly severe, with hundreds of thousands of accidents reported annually. This dataset offers a comprehensive view of car accidents in New York, including location, time of day, and number of persons injured.

The project's primary goal is to analyze this data and gain insights into the factors contributing to car accidents, while especially identifying areas where collision frequency is high and more safety measures are needed. The ultimate objective is to establish a more comprehensive understanding of car accidents in New York, promote safer driving practices, and reduce the number of accidents in the city

### DATA CLEANING
The dataset was downloaded through a captstone, it was uploaded on power query, using excel. The data was cleaned by replacing the empty blank cells with a values, New columns i.e year, hour, day of week, quarter, total killed and total injured were added on my spread sheet to give more detail and understanding dataset in order to give an accurate insight. 

### Analysis using Pivot Table
After cleaning the Dataset, i move over to my pivot table to analysis my questions.

## Questions for Analysis 
1. Compare the % of total accidents by month. Do you notice any seasonal patterns?
2. Break down accident frequency by day of week and hour of day. Based on this data, when do accidents occur most frequently?
3. On which particular street were the most accidents reported? What does that represent as a % of all reported accidents?
4. What was the most common contributing factor for the accidents reported in this sample (based on Vehicle)? What about fatal accidents specifically?
